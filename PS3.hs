-- Hmm...it seems to just ignore its second parameter.

fcomp :: (a -> b) -> (b -> c) -> a -> c

-- fcomp f g = (\x -> g (f x))
-- fcomp = flip (.)

-- Hmm...it looks like it wants us to give the first function a (b -> a)

-- const2 above.

-- that it can be fed into the second function.
fmapC :: (a -> b) -> ((a -> r) -> r) -> (b -> r) -> r

-- It looks like it feeds the third function as the second argument to the

-- we may consider the type of the flipped second function to be
-- ((b -> r) -> (a -> r)) because (->) is right-associative (due to currying).

fib :: Integer -> Integer

fib' :: Int -> Integer

fibs' :: [Integer]
fibs' = 0 : 1 : zipWith (+) fibs' (tail fibs')
fib'' :: Int -> Integer
fib'' n = fibs' !! n

-- The same thing, but with scanning. This works because the accumulator is
-- always one step ahead of the folding.
fibs'' :: [Integer]
fibs'' = 0 : scanl (+) 1 fibs''
fib''' :: Int -> Integer
fib''' n = fibs'' !! n

-- Ok, this is a bit tricky, but the technique required is similar to that

-- foldl (-) k      [] = \k -> id k
-- foldl (-) k     [2] = \k -> id ((-) k                 2)
-- foldl (-) k   [3,2] = \k -> id ((-) ((-) k         3) 2)
-- foldl (-) k [5,3,2] = \k -> id ((-) ((-) ((-) k 5) 3) 2)
-- So it looks like I just pass each successive computation into k, all the
-- way down the line. Thus, I am composing the accumulator on top of our
-- function, which keeps the last computation at the outermost level. This
-- composition makes a new accumulator. Note that each successive computation
-- substitutes in (-) k x for k, so this will be the value to pass to the
-- accumulator. The final function needs to be id so that the result is given.
foldlInR :: (a -> b -> a) -> a -> [b] -> a
